# AI_based_Probabilistic_Model_for_Hangman
 
This is a simple probabilistic model for predicting the next most likely missing letter, given a set of already filled up letters of a word, in a game of Hangman. The model has been trained on corpus present in vocab.txt. Please look at Problem 1.9 of the pdf to understand the algorithmic concept and the specifics of the implementation.
